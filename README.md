# Code Generation Model using Large Language Models (LLMs)

This project demonstrates how to build a code generation model using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The model is fine-tuned to specialize in understanding and generating code snippets.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Collect diverse code samples and documentation from GitHub using GitHub REST API.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform tasks such as tokenization, comment extraction, and deduplication.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** Train the LLM using supervised learning with code and related text pairs.
4. **Code Generation:** Generate code snippets from natural language descriptions.

## 📌 Features
- Collects code snippets and documentation from GitHub using the GitHub API.
- Preprocesses code data to ensure quality and consistency.
- Fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4, CodeGen) for code generation tasks.
